**Placeholder: Introduction** 

Hi, I’m Jenna. I am an MA student studying English literature with a specialization in Digital Humanities, and am starting my PhD in the fall of 2016. 

The goal of this short ebook is to introduce English students and academics to the ways in which DH can benefit your research. As a growing interdisciplinary field with vast amounts of talented scholars building exciting new things, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and to not know where to find one’s niche. My hope is that this ebook will offer some interesting and user-friendly methods to get involved in DH and that it will encourage users to continue experimenting. 

The tutorials and studies here are by no means all-encompassing, but is designed for beginners and those with no programming experience.  

This is intended to be an inclusive space. The DH world can be exclusive, while the Internet in general is sometimes a threatening place for those who diverge from the white-male “norm” (or even those white males as well!). I am committed to making spaces for everyone and to publish with awareness of these issues.
